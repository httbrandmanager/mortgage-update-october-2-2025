    <h3><em>Mortgage Rates Inch Up After Decline:</em></h3>
    <h3><em>What It Means for Central Texas Buyers</em></h3>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><em>October 2, 2025</em></p>
    <p>After several weeks of steady declines, mortgage rates inched up again as of October 2, 2025, according to <a href="https://www.freddiemac.com/pmms/pmms_archives" target="_blank">Freddie Mac’s latest Primary Mortgage Market Survey</a>. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose to <strong>6.54%</strong>, up from <strong>6.30%</strong> the previous week, while the 15-year fixed-rate mortgage climbed from <strong>5.49%</strong> to <strong>5.55%</strong>. Though modest, this increase reflects ongoing adjustments in the broader financial markets as inflation data, Federal Reserve policy, and economic growth continue to shape borrowing costs. For homebuyers across <strong>Austin, Buda, Kyle, and the Greater Central Texas area</strong>, staying informed about these rate shifts is key to making confident decisions.</p>
    <p>Despite the slight increase, housing demand remains strong. Purchase applications are up <strong>18%</strong> compared to last year, while refinance applications have jumped an impressive <strong>42%</strong>, showing that many homeowners are still finding opportunities to benefit from improved rates earlier in the season. This surge in activity underscores the resilience of the <strong>Austin housing market</strong>, where buyer confidence continues to hold firm even amid moderate rate fluctuations.</p>
    <p>Mortgage rate movements are influenced by several factors, including Treasury yields, inflation trends, and the Federal Reserve’s ongoing assessment of economic conditions. The recent uptick suggests that while long-term rates are stabilizing, short-term volatility remains. For Central Texas homebuyers, this reinforces the importance of monitoring market updates closely and being ready to act quickly when favorable lending conditions return.</p>
    <p>If you’re planning to buy a home or refinance your current one, now is the time to prepare. Getting pre-approved not only gives you a clear understanding of your budget but also strengthens your offer in a competitive market like <strong>Austin and Hays County</strong>.
